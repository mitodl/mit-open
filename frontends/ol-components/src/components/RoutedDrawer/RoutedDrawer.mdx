# RoutedDrawer

The Routed Drawer implements the [MaterialUI Drawer](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-drawer/) and monitors URL search parameters.

- It opens the drawer when all `requiredParams` are present in the URL.

- It closes the drawer when this condition is no longer fulfilled.

- It unsets the URL params when the drawer requests to be closed, closing the drawer.

- It contains a close icon button that unsets the URL params on click, closing the drawer.

The drawer `children` is a render function called with the following props.

- `params`: a state variable initialized with the URL search params.

- `closeDrawer`: a callback to unset the URL params, closing the drawer.

The goal here is twofold:

1. Make route-controlled drawers easy.

2. Help avoid issues where drawer content disappears before the drawer animations are finished.
