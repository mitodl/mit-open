# Unified Ecommerce in MIT Learn

The front end for the Unified Ecommerce system lives in MIT Learn. So, pages that exist here are designed to talk to Unified Ecommerce rather than to the Learn system.

There's a few functional pieces here:

- **Cart** - Displays the user's cart, and provides some additional functionality for that (item management, discount application, etc.)
- **Receipts** - Allows the user to display their order history and view receipts from their purchases, including historical ones from other systems.
- **Financial Assistance** - For learning resources that support it, the learner side of the financial assistance request system lives here. (Approvals do not.)
