## Integration

Integration with `open-discussions` is done so using the [open-disucssions-client](https://github.com/mitodl/open-discussions-client) project, which is [available on pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/open-discussions-client).

The client should be configured with a username matching a `django.contrib.auth.models.User` record in `open-discussions`.
