                "value": "&lt;p&gt;During our recent webinar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://exec.mit.edu/s/webinar-post/cybersecurity-resiliency-is-more-than-protection-MC46B3GFWOBBG65DS33EAESHQXRE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Resiliency is More than Protection&lt;/a&gt;, Executive Director of Cybersecurity at MIT Sloan (CAMS) Kerri Pearslon discussed the latest thinking in building cybersecurity strategy and the role of leaders and managers in creating cyber resilience. Simply put, companies cannot invest enough in technologies to protect themselves from every potential cyber threat; they must assume there might be an incident and design their cybersecurity strategy around resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Why resiliency?&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By now, many may be exhausted when it comes to the topic of cybersecurity risks and breaches. Despite (or perhaps as a result of) increased threats, it\u2019s become white noise. It seems like a never-ending and unwinnable game of whack-a-mole creating a valid sense of frustration. However, Keri insists there are still ways to protect yourself and your organization with the right shift in mindset and approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can\u2019t protect ourselves against everything\u2014thinking we can will quickly lead to burnout. (We will never win that game of whack-a-mole.) More realistically, we can put plans in place to help us respond to inevitable threats in a timely manner in order to return to normal operations as quickly as possible. \u201cProtection is about keeping the bad guys out, but resilience is assuming the bad guys will get in and having plans in place to really minimize the damage. Everyone says they have business recovery plans, but have those been tested in the context of a cyber-attack?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Keri uses a gym membership as an analogy. You go to the gym to build muscles and run faster, so when the time comes that you need to lift something heavy or quickly get away from a threat, you can. If you just join the gym and never go, it\u2019s the same as having a cyber-attack business plan, but never practicing it or running drills. \u201cHave you tested your backups? Have you tried to run your company on your backups? People are hesitant to do this because it causes disruption to the normal day, but it\u2019s necessary. A resilient organization recovers faster and maybe at a higher operational level. You learn faster. You build those muscles.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Known unknowns and unknown unknowns&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So how do we plan for what we don\u2019t know? Some might suggest Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help solve those problems, but it\u2019s still a nascent area of focus. Plus, the minute the larger public figures out how to implement those tools, the bad guys will just as quickly find a way to use that new technology against us. This is why having a general response plan is important.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, if (or rather, when) you experience a cyberthreat, who is in charge of communication and PR to the press? Do you have a press release template? Sure, that template isn\u2019t going to address everything, but a majority of the work is already done and you might only have to make some edits. This frees up valuable time. \u201cYou should know the kinds of things you may want to respond with. And the more you practice, the easier it is the absorb the shock and get back to normal.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, training is not enough.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Cybersecurity is everyone\u2019s job&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Decisions regarding cybersecurity are often made at higher levels of the organization or within IT departments. If people aren\u2019t part of those discussions, they may feel it\u2019s not their role\u2014someone else is taking care of it. However, there are weaknesses across your entire ecosystem and it\u2019s important to understand those and what people at each level can do to increase resiliency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s important to ask questions related to people\u2019s roles and raise awareness and shine light on cyber issues. It\u2019s the most important thing we can do as non-cyber managers. The bad guys thrive in the darkness.\u201d Keri suggests using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NIST&lt;/a&gt; framework, which helps you identify the various risks and responses. \u201cIt gives you a roadmap of where you might see something. What are the crown jewels in our processes?\u201d Identifying the big risks, with everyone\u2019s help and insights with a qualitative approach, can help decision makers understand how to properly distribute resources for the greatest amount of resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Cybersecurity and AI: Friend or foe?&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While AI has been around for a while, it has only recently taken off and become the favored hot topic of the business world. \u201cAI introduces a new set of cybercity concerns. It\u2019s like looking for a needle in a haystack.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Keri and the team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cams.mit.edu/research/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CAMS&lt;/a&gt; are focused on \u201csecure by design\u201d research that looks into the implications of AI. There are new big risks\u2014training data could be poisoned, models may be manipulated, output date may be intercepted and stolen, and there\u2019s also \u201cspoofing.\u201d There are general protections in place, but no widespread models for handling AI at the moment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conversations currently being had in the space ask the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 How can AI help us be more secure?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 How can AI introduce new attack vectors?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 How are people using AI that introduces risk?&lt;/p&gt;"

Cybersecurity is not a technology problem, but a business problem. For now, the best advice Keri has is to always verify. \u201cDon\u2019t take anything at face value that seems a little suspicious, especially anything that puts your valuables at risk \u2013 financially, personally, reputationally, operationally. If a system is asking for something, question it first.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And as previously mentioned, talk about it! (Remember, the bad guys thrive in the dark.) \u201cI\u2019m the only cyber person in my social group. However, because I\u2019m constantly talking about things I\u2019m seeing, they\u2019re all a little more aware, too. Now they\u2019re the ones sending me headlines. They\u2019re a little more secure and resilient because I talk about it in a non-threatening sort of way.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Keri teaches in two courses that help individuals and their organizations be more resilient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/cybersecurity-leadership-for-non-technical-executives/a056g00000URaaBAAT.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Leadership for Non-Technical Executives&lt;/a&gt;, the focus is on helping people become knowledgeable participants in the discussion. While the course is aimed at non-cyber professionals, often cyber professionals do take the class so they know how to communicate effectively with their non-cyber colleagues. There are hands-on exercises that simulate a cyber attack and resiliency. There\u2019s further discussion around the NIST mode, building a cyber aware culture, and debunking myths. In the end, participants leave with a personalized playbook with actionable next steps for improving a culture of cyber awareness within your organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/cybersecurity-governance-for-the-board-of-directors/a054v00000qmgE1AAI.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Governance for the Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt; provides a holistic, enterprise approach to cybersecurity and data privacy. Topics covered include governance, protection and response, law and regulations, and security strategy and culture. The goal of this course is to assist board members, C-suite leaders, and other senior executives in quickly gathering essential language and perspectives for cybersecurity strategy and risk management to better carry out their oversight and leadership responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contributed by Elaine Santoyo Goldman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

MIT Sloan was really a strategic choice driven by a desire to immerse myself in a culture of intellectual curiosity and innovation. The school&#39;s motto, &lt;em&gt;Mens et Manus&lt;/em&gt;, resonated with my passion for turning ideas into action and really complemented a pursuit of practical application, especially in my field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;MIT offered a unique platform to really expand my professional network and connect with industry leaders. I created tons of invaluable relationships with the course cohorts and world class faculty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;MIT aligned with all of my career and personal aspirations. My experience confirmed MIT Sloan as an ideal setting for growth as a leader in such a dynamic business landscape that we&#39;re in.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cms/delivery/media/MC5FH2XJPIYRFYNMBCBUN4Z5B6J4&quot; data-fileid=&quot;20YU1000004fo8H&quot; data-contentkey=&quot;MC5FH2XJPIYRFYNMBCBUN4Z5B6J4&quot; data-cms-filename=&quot;ace completion (1).JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joshua Gayman completed his MIT &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/earn-a-certificate/advanced-certificate-for-executives/a0F6g000005RcblEAC.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Certificate for Executives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you take away from the Digital Business courses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JG: &lt;/strong&gt;During &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/digital-learning-strategy/a056g00000URaaMAAT.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Learning Strategy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/business-implications-of-extended-reality-xr/a054v00000rHDUAAA4.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Business Implications of Extended Reality (XR)&lt;/a&gt;, I learned from Paul McDonagh-Smith.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Paul really is an icon for all the great things MIT has to offer. Digital business, VR, and XR are changing everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To give you an example, I was just in New York last week, and we captured an entire building project in 360-degree video. On Monday, we sent it over to our investors who put on the VR headsets we\u2019ve equipped them with so they can virtually tour the building from their office. We\u2019re able to give our investors an immersive experience from across the country. That\u2019s just one way that we are now using XR and VR in a practical way to really capture and create value for shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cms/delivery/media/MCCCB5MNDSGVF4LNK2ZNRKFF2L5M&quot; data-fileid=&quot;20YU1000004fw7Q&quot; data-contentkey=&quot;MCCCB5MNDSGVF4LNK2ZNRKFF2L5M&quot; data-cms-filename=&quot;1ultagKA.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Testing new technology at MIT Sloan Executive Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were your first courses you took at MIT Sloan Executive Education?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JG:&lt;/strong&gt; My first course was an online, asynchronous learning course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/blockchain-technologies/a056g00000URaa7AAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blockchain Technologies: Business Innovation and Application&lt;/a&gt;. It was fantastic! It really demystified how we can use blockchain in things like property technology. I found that very valuable. Then, my next class was an in-person week-long course, the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/entrepreneurship-development-program/a056g00000URaMsAAL.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Entrepreneurship Development Program&lt;/a&gt; (EDP). Bill Aulet, Paul Cheek, and everyone at the Martin Trust Center were fantastic. I\u2019ve done both the asynchronous and live online. I did online classes but also tried to take advantage of in-person courses as I could really immerse myself in the culture. All of those experiences were just world-class fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which course did you find most impactful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JG:&lt;/strong&gt; It would be so hard to pick a favorite! One of the things that stood out for me what building a company in one week at EDP with a team. I was the only person on our team from the United States and I&#39;m still in contact with all of those people. I just had the opportunity to be a reference for a major round of funding for one of my classmates in the program.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, there was a global management cohort during &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/global-executive-academy/a056g00000URaZQAA1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Executive Academy&lt;/a&gt; (GEA) last summer, and you know that&#39;s a 2-week experience where you&#39;re in Boston. That was a phenomenal experience. I took every chance I got to interact with the cohort and faculty. I&#39;ve even taken advantage of executive coaching with one of the professors, and that&#39;s been really valuable and really practical for my business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you keep in touch with past participants?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JG:&lt;/strong&gt; During the week of EDP, I made friends across the world from my cohort that I keep in touch with regularly. I also took the &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/global-executive-academy/a056g00000URaZQAA1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Executive Academy&lt;/a&gt; last summer. During that course, we went up to Harvard Square and put a \u2018Tim the Beaver\u2019 there. People are constantly getting together. Even last week when I was in Boston, somebody from the cohort drove up from Rhode Island to have dinner with me. Another time, other people from the cohort said they were in London for a conference if anyone wanted to meet up, and suddenly the group chat blew up with pictures of them hanging out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cms/delivery/media/MCHDSFITKGMFBJPNQFP3RVZGX5ZQ&quot; data-fileid=&quot;20YU1000004fztL&quot; data-contentkey=&quot;MCHDSFITKGMFBJPNQFP3RVZGX5ZQ&quot; data-cms-filename=&quot;gea on the river (1).JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joshua Gayman and colleagues from Global Executive Academy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is next for you and your business? How did MIT help you on that trajectory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JG:&lt;/strong&gt; We&#39;re in an interesting place with the real estate markets right now, both with technology innovation as well as what\u2019s going on financially. We\u2019re just trying on a daily basis to be better managers. MIT helped me to grow and really help people, especially when they are investing in our company. We\u2019re able to be stewards for our investors, applying the technology and innovation where we can and really having an astute understanding of what\u2019s happening in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you say to someone considering taking courses at MIT Sloan Executive Education?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JG:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;It is a well-rounded experience. I wanted to be become a better manager. I wanted to understand finance better. Being able to take MIT programs, where modern finance was developed, was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There was a blend of finance and entrepreneurship that was really cool. I think anybody that can go through the program is going to be blown away at the people they meet, the professors, the quality of the content, and how practical it is!&lt;/p&gt;"

Davis and Jay provide a general overview of some key hot topics during this webinar; however, they take a much deeper dive into the various complexities of family business during their popular in-person course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/future-family-enterprise/a056g00000URaa8AAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Future Family Enterprise: Sustaining Multigenerational Success&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Foundations of family enterprise success:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to be successful long-term, families need to be building value. However, value creation needs to include&lt;em&gt; all &lt;/em&gt;types of value \u2013 financial, intellectual property, social impact, reputational value, and talent. Owner Strategy and Systemic Investing are key at ensuring these are all addressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Growing value and \u201cstaying alive\u201d requires operational effectiveness and making good owner level decisions on time.&amp;nbsp;To ensure you\u2019re on the right trajectory, evaluate the strength of these key factors within your family enterprise:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Portfolio&lt;/u&gt;: You need the right division of assets and activities. A well-designed and &lt;em&gt;adaptive&lt;/em&gt; portfolio is necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Management and organization&lt;/u&gt;: Just like any enterprise, a family business needs management that is capable and aligned in order to be successful.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Good Ownership&lt;/u&gt;: A family enterprise needs loyal and capable owners who can agree on a way forward with what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. It means putting ego aside and not taking jobs they\u2019re not qualified for. The focus is on the greater good of the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Unified Family&lt;/u&gt;: A family that generally gets along is key so they can be unified on key values and support any other activities the family may have.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the world continues to change, a solid foundation is key but not enough. Davis states there are four big factors currently driving change and disruption across business and society:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Environmental Degradation and Ecological Disruption&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Socio Politcal-Economic Forces&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Geopolitics and (De)globalization&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Technological Advances and Digital Disruption&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With so many variables to worry about, how can you not only protect your enterprise but ensure it thrives for future generations? Davis\u2019 extensive research reveals that having an Owner Mindset is imperative for long-term survival.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Owner Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Davis shares that unfortunately, many owner families are thinking with an Operator Mindset \u2013 focused solely on operational excellence. That\u2019s just one piece of the puzzle. You need someone (or a group of people) to step up and think like owners focused on developing a comprehensive Owner Strategy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An Owner Strategy is the owner\u2019s overarching plan for the family\u2019s wealth and value creation \u2014 including the performance of their enterprise, and sustaining their success across generations. It identifies:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;types of value&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;key risks&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;organization, talent, and family needed&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;governance needed&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;plans to achieve goals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn the family enterprise world, if you\u2019re not developing assets and activities that engage the family and help motivate people to contribute and get good at various jobs within that enterprise, you won\u2019t succeed \u2014 not as a family enterprise,\u201d Davis states.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"

It\u2019s important to understand generation to generation who needs to be developed and what roles they need to occupy (and in some cases &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;occupy). It\u2019s not just about putting family in a role, rather it\u2019s about putting &lt;em&gt;qualified&lt;/em&gt; family in the&lt;em&gt; right&lt;/em&gt; roles so you can build a workforce that continues to attract outside talent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systemic Investing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Systemic Investing goes beyond philanthropy. Jason Jay, a thought leader on the topic, firmly believes family business should look at ways that they can participate in addressing systemic challenges, which in turn can support their own enterprise activities, create value, and spur innovation. In January 2024 the inaugural &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformation.capital/places/systemic-investing-summit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Systemic Investing Summit&lt;/a&gt; took place at MIT with over 150 global attendees from family offices, foundations, investment firms, and academia \u2014 demonstrating it\u2019s a rapidly growing area of research and implementation that businesses need to follow, or risk being left behind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principles of Systemic Investing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;New investment logic&lt;/u&gt;: With typical investing, people diversify in order to mitigate risk. However, systemic investing requires looking at multiple interventions within the same areas of concern and trying to determine how you can connect them in order to build value.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Polycapital Approach&lt;/u&gt;: This is the combination of assets (including philanthropy) and adding human, social, political, and spiritual capital. (Though Jay advises caution on leaning too heavily on political capital, which can become a barrier to advancement if tied too firmly to a particular incumbent).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;System Understanding&lt;/u&gt;: Mapping out the value chain, various stakeholders, and outside forces to identify areas to leverage is key. (System Dynamics \u2013 developed here at MIT and also taught by Jay \u2014 is an excellent framework for understanding these complex relationships).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nesting and Collaboration&lt;/u&gt;:&amp;nbsp;In order to build greater value, families should align themselves with other family enterprises and institutions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To see these principles in action, you can read one of Jay\u2019s recent case studies about the Fink family and their approach to tackling food waste &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4615351&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jay admits that working on systemic change, versus traditional philanthropy is more difficult and complex.&amp;nbsp;\u201cSome degree of concentrated effort is required to make systems change. At the same time, people have very different interest areas. The more people you successfully engage with, the more agendas in the room. But even in complicated 3-4 generation families, there\u2019s a degree of focus that can occur. They can get clear about their capabilities and what they want their legacy to be.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Davis and Jay hope you\u2019ll join them on campus for &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/future-family-enterprise/a056g00000URaa8AAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Future Family Enterprise: Sustaining Multigenerational Success&lt;/a&gt;. Designed for teams of four or more, the course leads multigenerational family teams through a week-long conversation to understand the future, assess their readiness for it, strengthen their approaches and capabilities, and plan for their continued success through this turbulent age and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to interactive classroom work and exchanges among families from around the world, family teams will have daily, private, facilitated discussions with an experienced family enterprise advisor to focus on their interests and agenda. Each family team will leave the program with a tailored action plan built together over the course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The course is offered each spring and fall.

                "value": "&lt;p&gt;During Women\u2019s History Month, it is important to celebrate the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. This month also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity. Many of the unique challenges women have traditionally faced when seeking to advance to senior levels appear to remain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the quest to advance women, MIT Sloan Professor Fiona Murray and Senior Lecturer Elsbeth Johnson, co-faculty of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/womens-leadership-program/a054v00000rfdVZAAY.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Women&#39;s Leadership Program&lt;/a&gt;, advocate for a critical shift towards embracing power. Women often excel in influence and communication, yet may shy away from seeking power directly. This hesitation can hinder progress towards senior executive roles, despite exceptional expertise across fields like science, law, or finance. The challenge is to normalize the pursuit of power among women, encouraging them to step forward and claim their place at the decision-making table. Murray and Johnson offer six approaches to help aspiring women leaders address these challenges and break through the glass ceiling\u2014once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;"

                "value": "&lt;h4&gt;Step up to power&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Key to overcoming the unique challenges that women leaders face is a focus on power. Leadership gender parity remains elusive because people in power (largely men) tend not to want to give up power, and when considering succession\u2014due to human nature\u2019s affinity bias\u2014look to self-replicate. Johnson and Murray have found that virtually all current leadership courses for women emphasize acquiring skills of influence and persuasion. This is not enough, argues Johnson. \u201cInfluence is power\u2019s poor relation\u2014it\u2019s what you do when you don\u2019t have power.\u201d Women are often already good influencers and communicators, yet are uncomfortable with the idea of taking power. The important step is to get comfortable, be ready for positions of power, and know how to take power.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Change the power mindset&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many high-achieving professional women with exceptional expertise, who could or should be stepping up to senior executive roles, hesitate or meet barriers. First, it is important they feel it is OK to say, \u2018I want power.\u2019 Power for a purpose, to achieve things\u2014not just positional power over people. \u201cIt\u2019s OK for us to say we want to get our hands on power, because we know we can make a difference once we\u2019ve got it,\u201d says Murray.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, they must realize that their work, however exceptional it has been, is not sufficient. It will not speak for itself. To advance, women need to be noticed, to be at the table, and not to undersell their work. There is an important performative element to leadership and this needs to come to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Play the power game&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For women who think playing the power game is perhaps too \u2018icky\u2019 or too political, it helps to consider the cost of not attaining power. Positional power is a zero-sum game. By refusing to play you are ceding power to people who are often less capable, maybe power-crazed, and certainly with a different purpose or agenda to yours. To find the energy, commitment and patience needed to pursue power, \u201cthink about the impact you want to have and why you\u2019re the right person to lead that change effort. That way, you\u2019re not just talking about yourself; you\u2019re talking about the journey you want to take with your team and for your organization \u2014 all of which can be energizing and doesn\u2019t have to be an either-or situation,\u201d says Murray.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Change the organization\u2014one step at a time&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Organizations need to change, yet it can be easy to be overwhelmed by the task. It helps to start at the thin end of the wedge and look for areas where the organization can begin to make a difference\u2014be that in development and mentoring, recruitment policies, or approaches to performance appraisals. It is also important to find male and female allies keen and able to push for the structural and procedural changes required to make the organization more supportive of aspiring women leaders. Always remember that, while change will be good for women, it will also be good for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Build a network of advocates&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To step up to senior roles, women leaders must go beyond having a professional network of people who give energy and share ideas. They need senior influential allies who will advocate on their behalf. \u201cYou need other people to advocate and to say, \u2018This is the person who should be put into this role,\u2019\u201d says Murray.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Building an effective network of advocates takes effort. As with building any professional network, it is more difficult for women than for men. As a rule, the overlap between a woman\u2019s personal networks and her professional network is smaller than the overlap for a man\u2014who will tend to play sports, go out for drinks, and socialize more with people from work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Show up authentically&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Authenticity is a prerequisite for good leadership, though the much-touted phrase \u2018bring your whole self to work\u2019 is misleading. It is important that the relevant parts of ourselves we bring to work are open, trustworthy, and reflective of our true values. Showing up authentically is a skill that requires practice. Traditional leadership constructs such as charisma and gravitas are largely based on male traits. Women should find their own versions of these terms that they are comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For women aiming for leadership roles, the path involves a nuanced strategy of embracing power, advocating for organizational change, building strategic networks, and leading authentically. This multifaceted approach not only paves the way for individual women to achieve leadership positions but also contributes to the broader goal of creating more inclusive and effective organizations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once you reach a position of power, it\u2019s important to support others in your organization, remind Murray and Johnson. This means amplifying quieter voices in a meeting or giving credit for an idea that initially didn\u2019t get traction. It also means encouraging autonomy and letting people do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s all about leaders needing to step up and be really clear about what\u2019s expected of people, so that they can then step back and let those other people make decisions and do the work that they ought to be doing,\u201d says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ready to claim the power you deserve?

                "value": "&lt;p&gt;Lauren Maffeo is a true lifelong learner. She earned her BA from The Catholic University of America, where she was a CUA Oxford Honors Scholar at St. Catherine\u2019s College, Oxford. She also earned her MSc from The London School of Economics and Political Science.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Maffeo was an associate principal analyst at Gartner, where she covered the impact of emerging tech like AI and blockchain on small business owners. She realized that as technology developed, her skillset needed to keep pace, so she began her learning journey at MIT Sloan Executive Education. She studied topics such as machine learning, Natural Language Processing, robotics, the ethics of AI, and building an AI roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen it comes to AI, it doesn\u2019t get better or more prestigious than MIT and it was an executive-level education that I could complete while working full time. Also, I chose MIT for the fact that real MIT professors are teaching the executive courses\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maffeo\u2019s learning and development budget from her company covered the cost of the course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/artificial-intelligence/a056g00000URaa3AAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Business Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, which she took in 2018. In her opinion, this was more manageable than taking time off of work to pursue a full-time two-year MBA. \u201cMIT Sloan Executive Education is a more realistic way of increasing your skills in a particular area without making a huge sacrifice in your professional or personal life,\u201d Maffeo shares.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFor anyone considering &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/artificial-intelligence/a056g00000URaa3AAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Business Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, if you\u2019re in a position at work to learn about AI technologies and integrating them into enterprises, this is an ideal program for you,\u201d Maffeo says, \u201cI was a research analyst who needed to understand the business use cases for AI as well as how to integrate AI at large organizations. Anyone in a similar position will get hands-on knowledge. Most academic programs are theoretical, but at MIT I was able to learn about the technologies and understand the possibilities within organizations.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2020, Maffeo began work at Steampunk, a human-centered design firm serving the federal government, where she wanted to work directly on technical teams performing research that would benefit products\u2019 users and works with engineers to build solutions for their problems. Taking the AI course through MIT Executive Education helped solidify that decision. \u201cWe need our clients to understand that AI is just data and data quality is the first step. Very often this means starting from scratch before you invest in NLP to solve various business challenges while helping clients understand what is possible,\u201d Maffeo explains.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maffeo currently leads initiatives around data governance, which inspired her to write her book, &lt;em&gt;Designing Data Governance from the Ground Up&lt;/em&gt;, when she realized the volume of data is increasing but the maturity of the organizations in terms of governing their data was stagnating.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI learned through working with AI that If your data quality is poor, there is very little you can do with it,\u201d Maffeo says. &quot;I&#39;ve carried this knowledge with me throughout my career, and MIT Sloan Executive Education was the tipping point when I decided that I&#39;d devote my career to easing this problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Want to make an impact on your career?

(So much for early retirement!) For the past five years, his work had centered around modernization and innovation within the Department of Defense (DoD) and general intelligence community. As he began delegating responsibilities ahead of his departure, he kept receiving calls from a variety of colleagues in different sectors. He had unknowingly become the go-to resource for those trying to implement &lt;em&gt;their own&lt;/em&gt; innovation and modernization efforts. Dave realized, if this was a need, perhaps he could form a consulting business around his expertise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dave already had a couple of Master\u2019s degrees\u2014an MBA and an MS in Strategic Intelligence\u2014along with various certifications, such as a Six Sigma Greenbelt. He felt he had a lot of practical experience helping people adopt agile project methodologies\u2014but there was still something missing. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything that I could point to and say \u2018I really do know what I\u2019m talking about.\u2019 I had a lot of what we refer to as \u2018war stories\u2019 and I didn\u2019t have much exposure to commercial and academic sectors.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;The MIT Edge&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As he researched various options, Dave discovered the&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/earn-a-certificate/executive-certificate-in-strategy-and-innovation/a0F6g000005RcbiEAC.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Executive Certificate in Strategy and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;, and he realized this was exactly the kind of credential he was looking for. \u201cMy MBA served me well, it provided foundational knowledge to help understand things at the academic level, but it didn\u2019t seem very practical or applicable. What I got from MIT was a lot of practical and useful knowledge.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He also appreciated that the faculty weren\u2019t just academic lifers hiding in their offices. \u201cFaculty were consulting on a number of projects; some had their own businesses they were running. When people asked questions, they could give really great answers that weren\u2019t just theoretical or academic. They were real-world answers to help explain the concepts being reviewed in class. That was hugely beneficial.\u201d&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;A fortuitous favorite&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI just want to be clear; all the courses were awesome! Hands down though, my favorite course was &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/leading-strategic-change/a054v00000rfYrsAAE.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leading Strategic Change&lt;/a&gt; with Elsbeth Johnson.\u201d Dave wasn\u2019t even supposed to take this course. A colleague was scheduled to attend and had to drop out at the last minute. They needed a replacement or risk losing the funding altogether. His loss was Dave\u2019s gain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dave really connected with the various practical frameworks. \u201cI wish I had her way of breaking up work so much earlier in my career. It would have helped me a lot.\u201d Additionally, the lengthier course timeline (five days, versus the more common two-day format) allowed for the class to dive deeper into the topics, as well as build stronger connections with each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"

The cohorts are also so diverse. For me diversity was whether someone was wearing a different color camouflage uniform! So, it was great to be a part of such an international group from across many industries. We have a WhatsApp group and we still have discussions and are in contact.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(And yes, that colleague who couldn\u2019t go is now trying to go to the next iteration after being told, \u201cYou missed the best class ever!\u201d)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling validated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/mastering-design-thinking/a056g00000URaa4AAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mastering Design Thinking&lt;/a&gt; also holds a special spot of honor. He left that course feeling \u201cvindicated and validated.\u201d Implementing change and innovation is not easy, especially in a highly bureaucratic system such as the federal government. Dave was feeling that his lack of charisma or providing clear guidance was hindering the organizations ability to adapt , having faced an uphill battle the last five years against people who were perfectly content with the status quo&amp;nbsp;and providing constant negative feedback towards any of his innovation efforts.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;During the very last slide of the course, the faculty focused on the fact that making these decisions (and pushing them through) is indeed hard work. \u201cHe said you\u2019ll be perceived as a dictator and then shared all these different personal examples of what he had been through. I thought if an MIT professor is experiencing this, then it\u2019s &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;just me. I\u2019m &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a bad leader and it\u2019s not that I couldn\u2019t explain things well\u2014it\u2019s that people sometimes just don\u2019t want to change. And that made me feel so much better. I still use that last slide and show it to other fellow change agents to prepare them that this is a real phenomenon. Emotionally, that was the best feel-good moment I had during my Executive Certificate journey!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cms/delivery/media/MCOAGGQ5CSMZG63A66ZOAMTZKX3Y&quot; data-fileid=&quot;20YU1000003fVLL&quot; data-contentkey=&quot;MCOAGGQ5CSMZG63A66ZOAMTZKX3Y&quot; data-cms-filename=&quot;dave mit collage.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;New friends and experiences while at MIT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice to others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dave had taken courses at other institutions, but things really clicked for him with his first course at MIT. \u201cOn day one, I just felt like \u2018this is exactly what I was looking for!\u2019 And so, it felt natural to go all the way through and get the Executive Certificate.\u201d For anyone considering an Executive Certificate (or even just one course), he emphasizes the hands-on learning as a differentiator. \u201cYou\u2019ll be well-served in terms of design thinking and the very practical examples from the professors and the members of your cohort who come from a variety of industries and countries! I don\u2019t know what other school will have that for you, but I can &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; say you\u2019ll get that at MIT\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\u2019s next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is hopefully not the last time we\u2019ll see Dave on campus.

With more than 13 years of experience in the finance industry, she has had the opportunity to work across many verticals within that field, from marketing to product ownership to product innovation. Now Jacqueline heads up a team focused on enabling the enterprise with strategic digital capabilities that can be scalable and future-proofed\u2014and that ultimately enable better experiences for the bank\u2019s employees and customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo that&#39;s what I\u2019m up to over here, enabling some cool technologies,\u201d she says humbly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline joined CIBC in 2022. Soon thereafter, she decided to pursue executive education to amplify her knowledge. \u201cA lot of my work is based on building digital strategies that are driven by cutting-edge technology, and that technology is changing so rapidly that I felt I needed a better way to stay up to speed on these advancements than simply absorbing snippets of educational content throughout my day,\u201d Jacqueline explains. \u201cI was looking for something a little bit more formalized. This desire was coupled with the fact that I wanted to make sure I was future-proofing my career development as well.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline decided to pursue an &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/earn-a-certificate/executive-certificate-in-digital-business/a0F4v00000W4D2uEAF.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT Sloan Executive Certificate in Digital Business&lt;/a&gt;, a certificate offering designed for professionals who want to stay ahead of the digital curve, whether to find new value for their businesses or to propel their careers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a woman in a male-dominated industry, Jacqueline encourages women at any stage in their career journey to 1) cultivate a strong network, 2) advocate for yourself and other women, and 3) never stop learning. \u201cWomen are significantly underrepresented in the Canadian tech industry,&amp;nbsp;making up only a quarter of the workforce. But education helps. It\u2019s a way to lean in.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;"

Then other technologies emerged that stole the spotlight. But as I dove into my work at CIBC, I realized AI coupled with AR can be a really powerful experience. There is going to be an important strategic relationship between AI and XR to drive the success of future products and programs. So, I entered this course with that mindset.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline remarked on the hackathon portion of the course, where she explored how XR can be applied strategically as well as participated in hands-on experiences with VR headsets. \u201cI had some vertigo at first, but you get used to it!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Equally interesting to her were the ideas and perspectives of other course participants. \u201cA discussion with someone from Deloitte prompted me to think, rather philosophically, about the future of vision. How will technology change how we see\u2014literally? And how does that impact the products and services we need to build out? If the future of vision is through an augmented reality type of experience, what will it mean to hold a mobile phone?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The course also helped her think more broadly about the application of augmented reality in industries like tourism or how extended reality may revolutionize our workplaces. \u201cThose two days opened my eyes to the future.\u201d Since the course, Jacqueline\u2019s piqued curiosity has made her more aware of developments in the marketplace and the new technologies that her company potentially could leverage in their product offerings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveling up with a global experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline also completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/artificial-intelligence/a056g00000URaa3AAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Business Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, a self-paced online course that she was able to complete remotely, and that gave her a deeper understanding of AI\u2019s applicability. \u201cBut there is nothing quite like the experience of being on MIT\u2019s campus,\u201d she explains. \u201cImmersing yourself in the Boston and Cambridge environment, being surrounded by intellectuals, even just for two days, it gets you in a different mindset. It levels you up a bit.\u201d Jacqueline also remarked on the impressive global reach of her in-person cohort. \u201cThere were people from Japan, India, Spain, and South Africa at my table, literally from all over the world, representing a wide range of industries. You couldn\u2019t ask for more.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another highlight for Jacqueline was the way faculty and peers made her feel connected to the larger MIT community. \u201cAt the end of the courses, it was clear that we weren\u2019t signing off forever. Now we\u2019re part of an extended MIT family, with the freedom to reach out to one another for connection and support.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline has two courses left to complete her Executive Certificate and is looking forward to coming back to campus soon, perhaps for &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/accelerating-digital-transformation-with-algorithmic-business-thinking/a056g00000URaaQAAT.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Accelerating Digital Transformation with Algorithmic Business Thinking&lt;/a&gt; and/or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/womens-leadership-program/a054v00000rfdVZAAY.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Women\u2019s Leadership Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust being in the room with seasoned executives is enough of a reason to enroll in an in-person course, but when you add in the element of where you are in the universe during the course, it&#39;s kind of a no-brainer.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cms/delivery/media/MCYJSU5LS74JD75KRC3PD5QYGL3M&quot; alt=&quot;Jacqueline DiFilippo in front of the MIT Dome&quot; data-fileid=&quot;20YU1000003SMru&quot; data-contentkey=&quot;MCYJSU5LS74JD75KRC3PD5QYGL3M&quot; data-cms-filename=&quot;J copy.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"

                "value": "&lt;p&gt;Originally from Galicia, David del&amp;nbsp;Rio&amp;nbsp;Vilas has been living and working in Madrid for more than seven years, where is currently the Head of Innovation for the services division (Ingesan) of OHLA, one of the five largest infrastructure companies in Spain. In his role, which is relatively new for the company, David is responsible for driving a systematic approach to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;David describes Ingesan as a mostly a B2G (business-to-government) company that serves public authorities, governments, and agencies primarily in Spain but also in Mexico and Chile, delivering fundamental services like waste collection, indoor cleaning, facilities management, maintenance, energy services, and social health services. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhile it is quite a diverse portfolio of services, we must deliver in a very constrained, very well-defined framework for innovation, given our relationship with public authorities,\u201d David explains. \u201cSo, how can we innovate in the public sector? How can we introduce innovation so that our more than 18,000 employees working in distributed places, such as public buildings, schools, universities, state courts, etc., can perform their tasks more efficiently and safely and in ways that can provide more value to our clients? This is my challenge.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A first taste of MIT, and a third way of innovating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a previous role as the global head of innovation of the services division of Ferrovial, a global operator of sustainable infrastructure, David participated in two collaborative programs with MIT in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) and the MIT Industrial Liaison Program (ILP). This was his first exposure to the thought leadership coming out of MIT Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI had the great fortune of working with MIT professors and also teams coming from the MIT Executive MBA program. It was a life-changing experience to work with these high-profile executives from different companies all around the world, all with very open minds and fantastic personal and professional profiles. This was also my first contact with the teachings from the Sloan School of Management. And some happened there for me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;David decided to enroll in Executive Education courses, beginning with &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/innovating-in-existing-markets/a056g00000URaaCAAT.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Innovating in Existing Markets&lt;/a&gt;, taught by David Robertson. \u201cThis course resonated with me because the services we offer are essentially commoditized, and we wanted to introduce fresh energy and innovation in the way we are perceived by our clients,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe course opened my eyes to new ways of rearranging our portfolio of activities and innovations so that, based on our core business, we could go \u2018around the box\u2019 and provide a clear, differential value to our clients.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He continues, \u201cInnovating in Existing Markets presented me with an innovation framework that was something other than the Blue Ocean Strategy or the Lean startup or the disruptive narratives that are everywhere in market but coming primarily from technology sectors. This was the first time I found a framework\u2014a \u2018third way of innovating\u2019\u2014that was fit for purpose in my organization and for my specific responsibilities. The approach is very reliable and very practical. It\u2019s about being faithful to our core business and our clients.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;David shared his takeaways with his colleagues upon his return, and his firm is currently exploring this innovation approach. \u201cI feel tremendously proud to see my colleagues understand it and make it theirs, and to see our clients experience the benefits of the approach. This is in no small part because every framework taught at MIT is backed up by analysis, research, and scientific evidence. The professors are capable of translating all the above into actionable managerial models for people who are not necessarily in the technology area. This makes it possible to confidently share these learnings with colleagues in ways that are easily comprehended.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;"

The course added more tools to his toolbox, particularly with respect to building a purpose-driven company that is faithful to its past while having a vision for the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next, David completed Bridging the Gap Between Strategy and Execution with Donald Sull, which helped him process what was required to realistically implement a framework for transformation. He completed his Executive Certificate requirements this year with &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/business-model-innovation-for-organizational-transformation/a056g00000URaabAAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Business Model Innovation for Organizational Transformation&lt;/a&gt;, Bill Fischer\u2019s course on synchronizing business models with corporate culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBill Fischer is an amazing professor in terms of the energy he pairs with his deep experience in many sectors and across many geographies. He is a master of understanding the cultural differences that make it possible to generate more value. During each of my courses I would think to myself, these MIT professors are superstars. They are like the Rolling Stones of education.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;David adds that the global perspectives participants bring to the classroom discussions are equally enriching. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to see how different people approach the same problem uniquely, depending on their culture. When you return to your everyday activities, you bring new insights and perspectives that change the way you do business. You also arrive more confident in your capabilities because you have been validated by people with deep expertise in their fields.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reaping the rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As someone who has been involved in R&amp;amp;D and innovation activities for more than 20 years\u2014previously as a researcher and an academic and now as an executive in the corporate world\u2014David defines his prior learning in the innovation space as self-dictated and primarily based on reading, experiences, and networks. \u201cHaving this opportunity at MIT was a chance to formalize my professional development in a way that was practical, hands-on, and tremendously valuable.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, his MIT journey was not without compromise. \u201cIt was an effort. I had to find the time. I paid for myself, my fees, my lodging. Also, I&#39;m not an English native speaker, so I have some challenges, but everyone is extremely respectful. I will tell anyone considering this journey that it is worth every expense. The education carries value. It creates confidence. The academic rigor is incomparable, and you bring that back with you. Every single day you will find an opportunity to put into practice what you have learned.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;David says he would be remiss not to mention one final benefit of the Executive Education experience. \u201cThe food! It is excellent. The diversity, the quality\u2014and I am saying this as a Spaniard! I was delighted.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;"

This framework (co-developed with Don Keiffer, with further refined with insights and expertise provided by Sheila Dodge) can help organizations better react to a rapidly changing world\u2014especially when it comes to knowledge work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most organizations are stuck making static plans\u2014whether it\u2019s a budget or a marketing strategy. However, in a rapidly changing environment, those previously well-thought-out plans can\u2019t account for all the inevitable hiccups encountered. As the organization tries to make adjustments and new rules, they inevitably create a more bloated process (and more workplace frustrations). While it\u2019s unrealistic to get rid of static structures like budgets, there are complementary sets of structures that can be implemented to allow for a nimbler response\u2014thus improving performance and reducing overload.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;The costs of overload&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When an organization (or an individual) takes on too much, it results in overloading and a decline in overall performance. All organizations are guilty of overloading to varying degrees, which is why it\u2019s important to learn how to manage the workload to match actual capacity. Dangers of an overloaded system include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inefficient task switching:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have too many projects, you\u2019re going to expend unnecessary mental energy each time you switch between them.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Capability Trap:&lt;/strong&gt; When you have too much to do, it\u2019s common to focus on short-term fixes versus long term investments. For example, you may be focused on closing that next sale, to the detriment of developing the sales pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queuing: &lt;/strong&gt;Overloaded systems are less capable of handling variation (and any minor variation erodes performance further). Just picture a major highway during rush hour traffic\u2014that pile up of cars is a visual representation of the workload trying to move through. If a car breaks down on that highway, that traffic becomes even more stagnant and inflexible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Minimizing overload allows an organization to be nimbler and effectively react as the world continuously changes around them. This is just one of the five core principles of Dynamic Work Design, known as Manage Optimal Challenge, which implements the pull system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Push vs Pull Method&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Work Design involves taking a best practice widely used in manufacturing and adapting it to knowledge work\u2014and this means using a \u201cpull method\u201d versus a \u201cpush method\u201d in prioritizing production schedules (or deliverables).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The push system, which many organizations fall prey to, has three big strikes against it:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It\u2019s slow:&lt;/strong&gt; A deliverable needs to stay in its \u201cpile\u201d until it\u2019s done and only then can it move on to the next step. One person could easily hold up the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual triaging: &lt;/strong&gt;We all have different ways of prioritizing our tasks and this introduces unpredictability, where some items will move slower through the pipeline than others depending on individualistic rankings. (Just think of your email box and how you might prioritize requests based not on actual urgency, but on who the request is coming from).&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expediting:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have an important deliverable that you don\u2019t want stuck in someone\u2019s pile, you may find a work around to ensure your request gets taken care of first and prioritized. (Maybe you\u2019ve cornered someone in the break room to remind them about an email you sent them). However, Repenning warns this creates a vicious and inefficient cycle. Your request may move to the top, but now everyone else falls behind. Soon, others start expediting to move to the top and \u2026 well, you can see how that doesn\u2019t help anything.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;"

You end up with piles of work sitting at each stage of the process before they can move forward and a bottleneck\u2014or overloading\u2014often occurs. By contrast, with a pull system:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You restrict the amount of work in the system.&lt;/strong&gt; Piles aren\u2019t allowed to accumulate at each step in the process, so you can easily see issues as they pop up. You can address where folks are behind. Or you can see where folks might be ahead and re-assign them to help stalled projects.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You prioritize only once.&lt;/strong&gt; Repenning uses the example of an airplane passenger list. Changes can happen to that passenger list up until the doors close. If someone wants to upgrade to first class or change their seat prior to the doors closing, it can be done. If that same VIP arrives after the door closes, it would be silly to bring the plane back to the gate and create a domino effect of chaos. Now other flights are delayed, the order on the tarmac is off, and connecting flights are impacted. (Keep that plane analogy in mind when folks are tempted to expedite).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It requires discipline, but if implemented properly, the pull system increases efficiency and flexibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The essence of Visual Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Visual management takes knowledge work and provides it with a visual manifestation so you can see the pull system clearly. This can be as simple as a system of post-it notes on a whiteboard. Each post-it is a deliverable and you review as a team to determine what needs to be done to move that post-it to the next step in the process. If there\u2019s an impediment, it can be addressed in the moment instead of languishing behind the scenes. (It doesn\u2019t have to be post-its\u2014a software like Trello works too if you have a remote team).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Visual management:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Gives knowledge work a physical manifestation&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Allows you to assess how much work is in the system&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Helps you populate the process&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Creates clear signals when the work stops&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Ignites problem solving&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you can see the work that\u2019s being done, it\u2019s easier to manage it. Repenning also cautions that the magic of visual management doesn\u2019t lie in the post-it. The key to success is the conversations you have with your team in front of the board about why the work is moving (or not moving). If folks are skipping the meetings with the excuse that they\u2019ll just look at the board later, you won\u2019t make progress. \u201cAnything that causes you to have better conversations is key. It\u2019s the human connection that creates the benefit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u201cOne weird trick!\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Repenning says that if you\u2019re going to do one thing to manage overload, it\u2019s important to create a \u201ccommon backlog.\u201d Everyone has their own to-do list, and it\u2019s important to get everyone in the room and get those on a whiteboard (or excel spreadsheet, or whatever visual system works for your team). Get everyone to identify their \u201chigh priority\u201d items, put them on a common list, then prioritize the items on &lt;em&gt;that list&lt;/em&gt; with a hard ranking. When you have your weekly meetings, review the common backlog, and find ways to move items off the list \u2026 &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;. Without this common focus, everyone defaults to working on their own priorities (e.g. individual triaging) versus the joint flow of work that benefits the greater good.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to learn more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Repenning goes more in-depth into all five principles of Dynamic Work Design during his MIT Sloan Executive Education courses (listed below). In keeping with MIT\u2019s motto of &lt;em&gt;mens et manus&lt;/em&gt; (mind in hand) participants are instructed to bring a small (but frustrating) problem within their organization to ultimately resolve thanks to a personalized action plan developed in class. It\u2019s tempting to want to tackle something big, but Repenning states that by solving one small problem first, it creates momentum and a solid foundation to continue solving additional and more complex issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/visual-management-for-competitive-advantage/a056g00000URaMuAAL.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Visual Management for Competitive Advantage: MIT\u2019s Approach to Efficient and Agile Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/business-process-design-for-strategic-management/a056g00000URaa1AAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Business Process Design for Strategic Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contributed by Elaine Santoyo Goldman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

                "value": "&lt;p&gt;Virtually every organization is actively pursuing the goal of becoming more data-centric, enabling them to swiftly uncover and respond to valuable insights. With generative AI, the power and potential of organizational data is bigger than ever before. In response, organizations often appoint chief data officers (CDOs) to lead them toward data-driven success.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://exec.mit.edu/s/faculty/faculty-detail-page?id=0036g00000uNcJjAAK&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thomas H. Davenport&lt;/a&gt;, Randy Bean, and Richard Wang conducted a global study to understand how this role is evolving, what the key priorities and roadblocks are for CDOs, and how they tackle generative AI. Their findings are presented in an AWS-sponsored report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://d1.awsstatic.com/psc-digital/2023/gc-600/cdo-agenda-2024/cdo-agenda-2024.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CDO Agenda 2024: Navigating Data and Generative AI Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;. One of the largest CDO studies in the market, it includes findings from a survey of 334 respondents with CDO or equivalent titles and level positions as well as qualitative interviews with 12 leading CDOs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Below are a few of their key learnings as they appear in the report.&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating visible value is still a key focus for many CDOs: &lt;/strong&gt;44 percent of CDOs still define success as achieving business objectives, as opposed to technical accomplishments (only 3 percent), and mark analytics and AI as keys to providing value. Other approaches include literacy training, councils across the organization, approaching data managem&lt;strong&gt;\ufeff&lt;/strong&gt;ent use case by use case, and the data product management approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDOs are enthusiastic about the potential of generative AI: &lt;/strong&gt;Generative AI dominated the discussion. The majority of CDOs (80 percent) agreed that it would eventually transform their organization\u2019s business environment, but they don\u2019t want to abandon existing data-related initiatives in favor of generative AI yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest roadblocks to generative AI\u2014data quality and finding the right use cases: &lt;/strong&gt;A large portion of CDOs (46 percent) rank data quality and finding the right use cases as the two biggest challenges for realizing the potential of generative AI, followed by (creating) guardrails around responsible AI, security, and privacy of data. Customer operation, such as customer support and chatbots, was the top generative AI use case (44 percent), followed by overall personal productivity (40 percent), and software code generation (36 percent).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data strategy is crucial to generative AI success: &lt;/strong&gt;More than half (57 percent) had not yet made necessary changes to their company\u2019s data strategies to support generative AI, but a majority (93 percent) of CDOs agreed that data strategy is crucial for getting value out of generative AI. A quarter of CDOs are pursuing data integration and cleaning, while nearly one-fifth are surveying data to understand what might support generative AI use cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture comes first, but challenges persist: &lt;/strong&gt;Culture is increasingly critical to effective data use, but CDOs are taking a \u201cslow and steady\u201d approach to changing it. Culture initiatives are a major focus for over half of the CDOs surveyed, including data literacy programs and change management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDOs embrace new data governance strategies: &lt;/strong&gt;Similar to last year, CDOs spend a substantial part of their time focusing on data governance activities (63 percent in 2023 vs. 44 percent in 2022). The new methods of establishing governance include an \u201cenablement\u201d focus\u2014making it easier to do the right thing with data\u2014and common data platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-driven transformation is a team sport: &lt;/strong&gt;Successful CDOs see their role as making their internal clients more successful in achieving their objectives. They don\u2019t focus so much on their own performance alone but on building coalitions to help their organizations succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://d1.awsstatic.com/psc-digital/2023/gc-600/cdo-agenda-2024/cdo-agenda-2024.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read the comprehensive report here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You may also be interested in MIT Sloan Executive Education\u2019s on-demand Generative AI Business Sprint and the week-long, in-person course &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/leading-the-ai-driven-organization/a054v00000r9U5cAAE.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leading the AI-Driven Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

                "value": "&lt;p&gt;Technological advancements are revolutionizing workplaces, and generative AI (GenAI) is a pivotal player in this current transformation. Its rapid adoption is evident with milestones like ChatGPT amassing more than 100 million monthly users in record time. This surge underscores a burgeoning trend across industries\u2014ranging from professional services to health care and finance\u2014where billions are invested in leveraging AI capabilities. While the narrative often focuses on organizational benefits, the implications for individual knowledge workers are equally profound and merit a deeper exploration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their recent article for &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2023/11/how-generative-ai-will-transform-knowledge-work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MIT Sloan Senior Lecturer and Principal Research Scientist George Westerman and Maryam Alavi, Professor of IT Management at Georgia Tech\u2019s Scheller College of Business,&amp;nbsp;suggest that knowledge workers leverage free GenAI tools already available on the web to reduce their cognitive load while also boosting their cognitive abilities and learning effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Knowledge work, characterized by cognitive processing and information handling to generate value, is a domain where AI\u2019s impact is particularly pronounced. This work spectrum includes both structured tasks (e.g., payroll processing) and unstructured ones (like conflict resolution). Generative AI is shifting the paradigm, encroaching into areas once exclusive to human intellect. This shift, while daunting, presents opportunities for knowledge workers to optimize efficiency and engage in more meaningful tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are three ways in which AI can augment knowledge work:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Reducing cognitive load:&lt;/strong&gt; Automating structured tasks allows workers to focus on complex, value-added activities. For instance, attorneys use AI for routine legal drafting, freeing up time for intricate legal analysis. Similarly, in marketing and finance, AI-driven content generation and information analysis are enabling professionals to concentrate on strategic aspects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Enhancing cognitive capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; AI tools can bolster critical thinking and creativity. Research indicates that AI engagement broadens the spectrum of questions and ideas, fostering innovation. Generative AI also aids in knowledge sharing, making organizational wisdom more accessible, as evidenced by firms like Morgan Stanley leveraging AI for knowledge dissemination among advisors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Facilitating learning and development:&lt;/strong&gt; AI is transforming learning methods, offering personalized feedback and simulation-based practice environments. For example, language learning platforms like Duolingo have integrated AI for interactive exercises, significantly enhancing the learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each person\u2019s GenAI explorations can generate innovations that could have great value. And yet, some of those experiments may stray into dangerous territory by creating errors, breaking regulations, making biased decisions, or releasing private information to the public. Here is how to can empower your teams to use AI responsibly:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish policies and responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Set clear guidelines on the safe and ethical use of AI, emphasizing data privacy and accuracy. Educate your team on the potential biases in AI and methods to counteract them.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote experimentation and share innovations:&lt;/strong&gt; Encourage your team to explore AI tools and share their findings. This culture of shared learning can lead to innovative practices and risk awareness.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate successes:&lt;/strong&gt; Acknowledge and celebrate innovative uses of AI within your team. This not only fosters a culture of innovation but also encourages others to adopt best practices.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The integration of generative AI into knowledge work is not a futuristic concept but a present reality. For senior executives, the challenge lies not in resisting this change but in harnessing its potential to enhance productivity, creativity, and job satisfaction among teams. The journey with AI is a continual learning process, one that requires proactive engagement and adaptation. The time to embark on this journey is now, ensuring that your organization stays at the forefront of this technological revolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Westerman teaches in the Executive Education course &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/essential-it-for-non-it-executives/a056g00000URaN9AAL.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Essential IT for Non-IT Executives&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You may also be interested in our on-demand &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/generative-ai-business-sprint/a054v00000r9S4fAAE.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Generative AI Business Sprint&lt;/a&gt; and the new in-person course &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/leading-the-ai-driven-organization/a054v00000r9U5cAAE.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leading the AI-Driven Organization&lt;/a&gt;.

In this setting, I firmly believe that kindness, empathy, and ethical practice are not just compatible with profitability, but are an essential component of it. My academic journey at MIT Sloan Executive Education, where I earned an &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/earn-a-certificate/executive-certificate-in-strategy-and-innovation/a0F6g000005RcbiEAC.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Executive Certificate in Strategy and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;, equipped me with sophisticated skills and an enriched understanding of innovation and its methodologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My study experience at MIT has been wonderful, and two courses in particular stand out: &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/mastering-design-thinking/a056g00000URaa4AAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mastering Design Thinking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/understanding-global-markets/a056g00000URaZRAA1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understanding Global Markets: Macroeconomics for Executives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Mastering Design Thinking&lt;/em&gt; provided me with an effective approach to project development. It&#39;s a human-centered design process that addresses problem-solving by focusing on user needs and includes concept development, applied creativity, prototyping, and experimentation. In the course on global markets, I learned to analyze tools to understand and predict economic performance in the medium and long term. This knowledge assists in risk mitigation, the development of growth strategies, and making investment decisions in business and development projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This training was pivotal, allowing me to forge vital tools for creating new organizational models and procedures. Thanks to this, I also had the privilege of being mentioned by Forbes Italy as one of the TOP 100 CMOs in Italy, and by Capital magazine as one of the top 150 Italian managers under 44 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;"

This highlights an urgent call to action: to not only sustain but also quicken the pace of digitalization in our businesses. I have written at length on the digitalization setbacks faced by Europe and Italy. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidesartini.com/pubblicazioni/meteore&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meteore&lt;/a&gt; (Italian), I offer an analysis of the journey as these regions strive to match the rapid pace of digital progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, innovation transcends the mere adoption of new technological tools. It&#39;s equally about refining the fabric of interpersonal relationships within an organization. In my role at G. Mondini S.p.A., I have taken this to heart by expanding my focus beyond mapping core processes, flow charts, and value stream maps. I focus on relationships and human value, convinced that the engagement and involvement of people in creating a team are crucial for success. Evidence from social psychology suggests that leaders who foster positive, kind employee relations achieve superior outcomes (see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2022/06/the-power-of-healthy-relationships-at-work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article). I believe that the power of personal connections underpins true success, going far beyond simple &quot;technique.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I view education not as a destination reached with the completion of a degree, but as a launching pad for real-world application. The real thrill lies in the constant application of my skills, an adventure continuously shaped by my years of study at MIT Sloan Executive Education. It&#39;s this relentless pursuit of innovation that can inspire renewed confidence in people and strengthen the team.&lt;/p&gt;"

Phishing emails are even more convincing than before. New code can be generated easily that create new types of malware.&amp;nbsp;And I\u2019m sure there will be new, innovative attack vectors that we cannot even imagine today.&amp;nbsp;So, what are we supposed to do?&amp;nbsp;Because we know these are coming, we have to take steps now to be cyber resilient.&amp;nbsp;Technology can help, but it\u2019s not 100% effective at protecting us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think 2024 is the year that our mindsets change from just protecting us from cyber-attacks (which must be done and are table stakes at this point) to resilience.&amp;nbsp;Companies that practice cyber resilience do several things differently.&amp;nbsp;First, the mindset is different.&amp;nbsp;Resilient companies expect to be attacked and set up processes and activities, so the recovery is as fast as possible.&amp;nbsp;They practice how to respond and recover with tabletop exercises at all levels (including the Board of Directors) so everyone knows what to do in the event of a breach.&amp;nbsp;They design their systems architecture with cyber recovery in mind.&amp;nbsp;They don&#39;t just back up their systems, they find ways to back up their systems, so they are not impacted by the cyber breach.&amp;nbsp;They have executives (and board members) ready to go in the event of a breach.&amp;nbsp;They discuss and decide their approach to paying a ransom, should they be hit with ransomware.&amp;nbsp;They don\u2019t wait until they are held ransom to decide what to do. Most importantly, everyone in the organization is part of the cybersecurity team, from the lowest level clerk to the most senior executive.&amp;nbsp;Everyone has a role to play, and they know what it is. In short, resilience will become the prevailing approach to cybersecurity. We really don\u2019t have any other options at this point.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pearlson teaches in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/cybersecurity-governance-for-the-board-of-directors/a054v00000qmgE1AAI.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cybersecurity Governance for the Board of Directors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/cybersecurity-leadership-for-non-technical-executives/a056g00000URaaBAAT.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cybersecurity Leadership for Non-Technical Executives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steven Spear says trade long range views for agility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;\u201cParticularly in turbulent periods, having and holding to \u2018long range views\u2019 with their associated planning is not only difficult but potentially counterproductive.&amp;nbsp;Better to build ability to explore the frontier of what we don\u2019t yet know and be agile in characterizing situations, identifying and generating solutions with a request frequency and speed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why?is&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re always under some pressure to have a long range view; without one how could we possibly plan? And, if in normal circumstances we might be lackadaisical in getting those views fresh\u2014after all, we trust things\u2019ll just keep cruising along. When things get more turbulent (and we\u2019ve certainly experienced public health, economic, political, and military turbulence in a few-year period), there\u2019s added pressure to break out of the status quo, invent new approaches and lock in on them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That might be satisfying but, in fact, could be self-jeopardizing. The very turbulence to which we are responding is indication that we don\u2019t, and actually can\u2019t, well predict for the future, so preparing for some narrow set of future sets, well far from the horizon, can well mean committing to a high risk, low return losing bets. Better to create value by preserving our options to act, across a broader range of situations in shorter lead times than longer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We do this in several ways. First, we must be exploring relentlessly, designating some of our time and some of our colleagues to be observing and experiencing situations that are unfamiliar, uncertain, or unknown and characterizing what they find in terms of problems, problem holders, characteristics of possible solutions, and so forth. Those are necessary first steps in consistently innovating at speed. Internally, we must be wildly self-critical of our processes for everything from upstream discovery and development through design and deployment, fueled by the questions of how we can make complex collaborative creative workflow faster and easier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spear teaches in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/creating-high-velocity-organizations/a056g00000URaZDAA1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating High Velocity Organizations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/leading-organizations-for-high-velocity-performance/a054v00000rHYr9AAG.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leading Organizations for High Velocity&amp;nbsp;Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;You can also learn more in his new book&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wiring-Winning-Organization-Slowification-Simplification/dp/1950508420/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wiring the Winning Organization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Carrier on system performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The new year is poised to be a year of profound introspection for organizations, particularly in their efforts to align the &#39;backlog of technology investment&#39; with actions that not only create value for customers but also alleviate stress on the organization&#39;s workforce and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of inflation and heightened interest rates, corporations are expected to scrutinize their internal processes, identifying areas where system performance falls short of the sum of its parts. The emphasis will shift towards driving emergent performance through the creative contributions of employees, grounded in System Dynamics. Companies relying solely on financial investments to overcome current challenges are likely to face difficulties, given the importance of resiliency and strategic resource allocation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrier teaches in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/building-organizational-resilience/a056g00000URaadAAD.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building Organizational Resilience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/implementing-industry-4.0/a056g00000URaZvAAL.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementing Industry 4.0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie Woerner says generating value from digital requires investing in people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn our conversations with companies this year, we saw business transformations slowing down as other priorities emerged. Becoming future ready is always a moving target, and companies must continuously evolve their capabilities to generate new value from digital. The capabilities built in a transformation enable future technology efforts, such as incorporating machine learning and generative AI. It often takes a refocusing effort to regain momentum, which involves more stakeholders, customers, and business leaders, and continuing to automate repetitive tasks and make more data accessible. Getting value from those capabilities will require investing in and developing your people and often fundamentally retraining teams to overcome as skills gap.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woerner teaches in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/digital-strategies-for-transforming-your-business/a056g00000URaZLAA1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Strategies for Transforming Your Business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul McDonagh-Smith anticipates a \u201cpotentiality paradox\u201d with respect to generative AI &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;\u201cIn 2024, as transformative technologies including generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) flow further into our organizations and networks, we can expect to see what I call a \u2018potentiality paradox\u2019 come into sharper focus. To realize the potential of this technology, our organizations will increasingly rely upon human capabilities such as creativity, curiosity, critical thinking, collaboration, and consilience\u2014the concept of unification and unity. In 2024, we will uncover and discover new technology elements to add to our toolkits; however, the ways in which we combine transformative tech with human elements such as curiosity, creativity, and compassion will determine how robust, sustainable, productive, and profitable we will become in this next phase of the digital economy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;McDonagh-Smith teaches in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/leading-the-ai-driven-organization/a054v00000r9U5cAAE.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leading the AI-Driven Organization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/generative-ai-business-sprint/a054v00000r9S4fAAE.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generative AI Business Sprint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

                "value": "&lt;p&gt;When we asked Jonathon Feit to share his MIT experience with us, and to catch us up on everything that has happened since, he was naturally reflective. While so much has happened for Jonathon in recent weeks and months, he couldn\u2019t help but think back to the early aughts and the decisions and experiences that brought him to this moment in time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From co-founding the magazine &lt;em&gt;Citizen Culture&lt;/em&gt; at just 23 years of age to becoming a pioneer in the shift to digital publishing to his stint as the youngest faculty member at Boston University\u2019s College of Communication, Jonathon has always been an innovator, and entrepreneur, and someone determined to move his industry forward\u2014whatever that industry may be. He has always had an uncanny ability to seize upon a truly disruptive idea. But perhaps most interesting about Feit is how he has been able to take kernels of ideas\u2014even failed ideas\u2014and ignite them into lifechanging solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;From magazines to movements&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBack when I was teaching a digital innovations course at BU, the capstone assignment for my class was to produce a prototype and, more importantly, a business plan for an innovative media product,\u201d says Jonathon. \u201cAnd even though this was 2006, 2007, I still remember a couple of them. One was a model of advertising comprising three-second ads. I remember saying, \u2018there&#39;s no way that&#39;s going to fly.\u2019 Of course, it turns out in Europe they do those all the time, as quick interstitial ads,\u201d he laughs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe other one was a same sex wedding magazine, and I remember thinking, &lt;em&gt;that&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; interesting. This was a time when that was still a very hot topic, and the team came up with a compelling presentation. When the course was over, I actually ended up prototyping a magazine with them called &lt;em&gt;With This Ring&lt;/em&gt;. It turned out to be the first inclusive\u2014same sex, interracial, and interfaith\u2014wedding magazine.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathon described it as a publication that included style and fashion features, interviews, profiles, and content patterned on the kinds of articles one would see in magazines like &lt;em&gt;Cosmo&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Glamour&lt;/em&gt;. It was both familiar and entirely novel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI got a live, in-person interview with Gavin Newsom when he was the mayor of San Francisco. And so being able to talk to him about same-sex marriage when this was an actual question\u2026I mean, it was compelling. But by the time the next presidential election cycle occurred, the whole idea of same-sex marriage seemed to be something America claimed it wasn\u2019t ready for. We were early. Three or four years later, we would have been a roaring success,\u201d says Jonathon. Then he laughed. \u201cBut it was great. A straight white single man publishing a magazine about literally everything else.\u201d&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathon moved back to his hometown of Los Angeles, the magazine behind him and an uncertain political climate ahead. He had begun working with a partner to develop a website for event planners, and the idea hit him that same-sex weddings were a natural adjunct for this product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis was back when the controversy first erupted around wedding vendors who refused to serve same sex couples. I realized that even though the publication wouldn\u2019t necessarily work, we could develop a tool that would help individuals find friendly vendors.\u201d Jonathon explained how the tool evolved into an early model of affiliate marketing, where anyone could post an event and then find everything \u201cfrom the venue to the clothes to the flowers to the cigars.\u201d Jonathon\u2019s business would collect a small fee as people and businesses transacted, like a small software-as-a-service venture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was exciting, because a social movement was mounting, and we were going to be a positive part of that movement.\u201d Jonathon was also excited because this was when he decided to enroll in MIT\u2019s week-long &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/entrepreneurship-development-program/a056g00000URaMsAAL.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Entrepreneurship Development Program&lt;/a&gt;, to acquire additional skill sets that would help propel their company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this was also the moment that his business partner, who was responsible for developing the code essential to powering the tool, disappeared\u2014and took the code with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m not a coder. I\u2019m a business guy, a writer, a marketer,\u201d Jonathon explains. \u201cSo, when that partnership ended abruptly, I was in no man\u2019s land.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;A pivot into healthcare, inspired by EDP&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When Jonathon walked onto the MIT campus, his wounds were still fresh. But early into the program, he had a transformational learning experience with Mike Grandinetti, an entrepreneur, innovation expert, and award-winning professor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMike was teaching a session on product-market fit. He gave us a challenge. Take an idea that you\u2019ve had as an entrepreneur and move it in a different direction. For example, ask yourself, if you were going to start your entire career over, what would you do? And could that idea you had somehow be applicable in that entirely new career?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For Jonathon, part of that answer was easy. He always had a deep passion for the biomedical sciences. In fact, many of his studies in school involved neuropsychology or medicine. \u201cI come from a family with a lot of doctors in it,\u201d says Jonathon, \u201cand the idea of going into the medical business was really compelling, but I was a journalist\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen I started working in journalism, I was looking at science journalism and really interested in areas like biopsychology and neuropsychology, maybe in part because I have Tourette&#39;s syndrome. Some of these topics appealed to me because I lived them. So, when Mike said, \u2018start over,\u2019 I asked myself, if I were to go into the biomedical field, into the business of science, what would I do?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that\u2019s when it struck him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathon asked himself I he could take the same concept of putting all the pieces together for an event and instead use it to look at a healthcare experience. In particular, how could he help people with a physical disability or a disease, like diabetes? What do they need? What are all the pieces that need to be brought together?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His mind began to race as he realized that the idea of assembling an ecosystem of information for events could laterally apply to viewing, in one place, a range of information that is relevant to caring for patients with serious, often chronic diseases and many caregivers who want to pull in the same direction but find it fiercely challenging to share information cohesively, securely, and quickly.&amp;nbsp;In that moment, in that classroom, the idea of MEDIVIEW was born.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;How a week can change an entire profession&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, Jonathon\u2019s journey had more road to hoe. A year after EDP, after toiling with entrepreneurship, he decided to enroll in an MBA Program at Carnegie Mellon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou might remember 2008. That may have been the single worst time to be in business school,\u201d he says with a laugh. The economy may have been falling apart around him, but serendipity led him to his next business partner, Chris Witt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cms/delivery/media/MC7PJALT6VIZEGHFPGOXCKW7NPNM&quot; data-fileid=&quot;20Y4v000000KzOg&quot; data-contentkey=&quot;MC7PJALT6VIZEGHFPGOXCKW7NPNM&quot; data-cms-filename=&quot;Jonathon with Cofounder Chris Witt (2).jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathon with Cofounder Chris Witt&lt;/em&gt;\ufeff&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cChris had worked at Boeing. He&#39;s a genius technologist. We got together with the idea that we would start a company. His father William, who had recently passed away in a car crash along with Chris\u2019s sister Sarah, was a full-bird colonel in the U.S. Air Force. So, Chris had a strong orientation toward military applications for whatever we would create together\u2014as did I, because I enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve on September 11, 2001. The original plan was to become a field medic.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathon and his new partner compiled their knowledge and decided to focus on a device that would conduct rapid diagnosis and therapeutics on patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury\u2014a need of particular significance for active military and veterans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"

Talk to your customer. Understand what their needs are. And so, we picked up the phone and we called the Army and we talked to medical commanders who said, \u2018we love the idea of providing therapeutics to war fighters and the veterans who are suffering, but we don&#39;t know enough about the patients to administer those therapeutics.\u2019 They wanted us to focus on the diagnostics.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The pair dove headfirst into understanding how diagnostics are conducted in the field, how and where that data is collected, and how responders and doctors come to understand the mechanisms of the injuries and the patients\u2019 social determinants of health. Next, they needed to figure out how all that critical information could be integrated and presented on a screen such that the responders in the field and the hospitals providing care had context. Jonathon, of course, had the perfect solution for that: MEDIVIEW.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond Lucid Technologies has been going strong for fourteen years. Between 2013 and 2023, MEDIVIEW has been used by Fire and EMS agencies in 33 states and territories, with 300+ hospitals on their interoperability (patient information sharing) network. Their reach and applications continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn Oregon, for example, we implemented the country&#39;s first interoperable registry of children with special health needs, severe illness, and disability. The platform is called the MEDIVIEW BEACON Prehospital Health Information Exchange. And so, when I say that one week at MIT changed my life, I also mean it has changed and continues to change the lives of children and adults whose special health and end-of-life medical orders are now visible to the responders in the field, the 300 hospitals that are on the network, and the health information exchange across multiple states.\u201d&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathon mentions that MIT factors into his business in more ways than one, noting that their Chief Engineer, David Saylor, is an MIT alumnus.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cms/delivery/media/MCYRGYDEJZ4VEDHLOGSFBXCLSTM4&quot; data-fileid=&quot;20Y4v000000KzOb&quot; data-contentkey=&quot;MCYRGYDEJZ4VEDHLOGSFBXCLSTM4&quot; data-cms-filename=&quot;David Saylor Chief Engineer MIT &#39;04, &#39;05 (2).jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Saylor Chief Engineer MIT &#39;04, &#39;05&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He also cites an influential EDP lesson from Professor Ken Morse, Founding Managing Director of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center, who said that a CEO has one duty: to find, train, and retain \u2018eagles\u2019\u2014the absolute best talent one can attract and ideally far smarter than the CEO doing the recruiting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the time we spoke with Jonathon, Massachusetts had just signed a contract with his company (Beyond Lucid Technologies, Inc.) to begin bringing EMS and fire data to all the hospitals on their statewide network.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAll of this links back to that one week in EDP. We can literally say this one program changed an entire profession.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re all here to start the next big thing\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathon and his company continue to break new ground. Beyond Lucid Technologies was the first to put telemedicine in the back of an ambulance, the first to put speech-to-text in an ambulance, and the first to put social determinants tracking for longitudinal views of patient&#39;s health over time in an ambulance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo one had done this before. And it&#39;s all based this thing that I prototyped in EDP. Sometimes I ask myself, what would have happened if I had never enrolled? It\u2019s serendipity. And it\u2019s like that movie, \u2018The Adjustment Bureau.\u2019 MIT\u2019s Entrepreneurship Development Program was like my Adjustment Bureau. And you can quote me on that!\u201d&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathon also laughs thinking about how none of this might have happened if the code for his event planning tool hadn\u2019t been stolen. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re literally connecting healthcare ecosystems across the United States and beyond. You can&#39;t pray for that, let alone plan it. So, it&#39;s a pretty remarkable set of confluences.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Central Shenandoah EMS (CSEMS) Region of Virginia announced the deployment of KIDS OF VALR (Virginia Life Registry), a local program of the R.U.S.H. (Rare &amp;amp; Under-Served Health) Initiative for Children.&amp;nbsp;Beyond Lucid Technologies launched the R.U.S.H. Initiative for Children to close critical gaps in care by pairing data systems with both emergency and non-emergency clinical partners, in service of vulnerable young people with serious illnesses and disabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The program, which is sponsored in part by Amazon Web Services\u2019 Health Equity Initiative, brings together a range of clinical partners and tech-enabled services\u2014including Jonathon\u2019s company\u2014to share information in real-time, when a young person is in healthcare distress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere is making money, and then there is making an impact. It\u2019s an important thing to be able to make money; obviously, you don&#39;t go to someplace like MIT Sloan to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make money. But, to make an impact, especially at a scale where you can solve for parents having to tell responders over and over again about their kids\u2019 needs\u2014that\u2019s another thing entirely. Then to have Amazon say, \u2018we believe in what you&#39;re doing and here&#39;s money to support it,\u2019 well, it\u2019s truly remarkable.\u201d&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathon admits that he wasn\u2019t the only EDP participant more interested in disruption than incremental change. \u201cI think this &lt;em&gt;defines&lt;/em&gt; the EDP participant. I remember sitting in one of the big assembly rooms at MIT surrounded by global entrepreneurs, people from firms like Accenture and Deloitte and Bosch, and then there was me, an independent magazine publisher. And I realized, everyone was here to start, or try to start, the next big thing. And it was the most electric, energetic, motivating feeling I&#39;ve ever had in my entire career.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are ready to change your industry and potentially the world, we invite you to learn more about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/entrepreneurship-development-program/a056g00000URaMsAAL.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Entrepreneurship Development Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about the MEDIVIEW Platform and Beyond Lucid Technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beyondlucid.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

                "value": "&lt;p&gt;What makes the greatest organizations not just succeed but consistently excel? According to MIT Sloan Senior Lecturer Steven Spear (&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/creating-high-velocity-organizations/a056g00000URaZDAA1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Creating High Velocity Organizations&lt;/a&gt;) and Gene Kim (founder and former CTO of Tripwire), highly successful companies have created management systems that liberate people&#39;s minds\u2014individually and through collective, creative collaboration\u2014to tackle super hard problems, the solutions to which have enormous societal value. And they can do this better, faster, easier, and more consistently than their counterparts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their new book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wiring-Winning-Organization-Slowification-Simplification/dp/1950508420&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wiring the Winning Organization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (available November 21), the authors contend that we form enterprises in the first place to tackle problems that would otherwise overwhelm us individually. Finding and deploying solutions requires too much time, expertise, and perspective for any person or small group to master. That&#39;s why some organizations comprise thousands of individuals, each contributing their ingenuity toward collective actions and a common purpose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;In organizations that are led best, all stakeholders benefit: employees invest their time to do work that is appreciated by others; investors gain returns on resources they provide; and the students, patients, customers, and others receive exceptional products and services in exchange for the trust they\u2019ve placed in providers,\u201d write the authors. \u201cIn those less well-managed, people\u2019s time is squandered, spirits are squashed, material resources are wasted, and societal needs are left unmet.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Slowification, simplification, and amplification&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The efficiency and innovation in problem-solving are not just a matter of scale but of strategic methodology. Spear and Kim discuss how leading organizations facilitate problem-solving by creating conducive environments, simplifying challenges, and recognizing the need for solutions. They refer to these pivotal mechanisms as slowification, simplification, and amplification. In identifying these mechanisms, they show how familiar practices\u2014lean, agile, six sigma, &quot;containers&quot;, DevOps, etc.\u2014all work by liberating people&#39;s ingenuity individually and collectively to do accomplish great things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The book provides varied and numerous examples to demonstrate their point, from NASA&#39;s recent deflection of an asteroid to Apple\u2019s triumph in the smart phone market to great medical care achievements. No surprise, Toyota offers tremendous lessons, too. These examples are not mere anecdotes but are underpinned by robust theories from thought leaders and draw on numerous frameworks developed at MIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The culmination of a decade-long collaboration between the authors, Wiring the Winning Organization distills their research and experience into essential mechanisms that anyone responsible for coordinating the efforts of other people can use to generate greater outcomes quicker and easier than otherwise would have been possible. \u201cScale doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d writes Spear in the book\u2019s preface. \u201cWhether it\u2019s five, fifteen, forty-five, or five hundred people, there are ways to set them up for success (or not). This is regardless of whether they\u2019re doing esoteric, upstream research or are involved in the most basic production and delivery of goods and services. And it is regardless of the sector in which they work. There are better and worse ways to bring the parts into an outstanding whole.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cms/delivery/media/MCUQEPUGZEXVAS5BUWEXUPBMJMDI&quot; data-fileid=&quot;20Y4v000000KzCX&quot; data-contentkey=&quot;MCUQEPUGZEXVAS5BUWEXUPBMJMDI&quot; data-cms-filename=&quot;book blog2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the book\u2019s foreword, Admiral John Richardson of the US Navy and former Chief of Naval Operations writes, \u201cWiring the Winning Organization presents a theory of performance. In my experience, the best theories describe complex things in a way that is elegant and simple. The theory set out in this book meets these criteria, presenting the ideas of slowification, simplification, and amplification as mechanisms to consistently create superior performance. Gene and Steve provide a clear and accurate way of understanding the very complex problem of designing an architecture for success.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The book is currently available for pre-order and will be released Tuesday, November 21, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wiring-Winning-Organization-Slowification-Simplification/dp/1950508420&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Purchase on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Explore concepts presented in the book firsthand from Steve Spear during his upcoming course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/creating-high-velocity-organizations/a056g00000URaZDAA1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Creating High Velocity Organizations&lt;/a&gt;.

His tech journey ignited at the age of 16 when he started developing web applications. In 2009, he established Zenx IT, a company specializing in building digital solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Antonio has lent his expertise as CTO and technology consultant to various tech startups, all while crafting digital products for large enterprise clients. Antonio is the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://djangobyexample.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Django by Example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Python programming book that has helped many individuals worldwide to learn programming, with four editions published in eight languages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Antonio&#39;s international experience spans Madrid, Beijing, and London. He holds an MSc. in Computer Science from ICAI - Universidad Pontificia Comillas and remains passionate about supporting and investing in early-stage startups.

The decision to pursue AMP was driven by a pivotal moment in his career. &quot;After a frenzy six-year ride on the startup rollercoaster, building and scaling a fintech company, I found myself on the verge of our company being acquired. It was a pivotal moment. I recognized the need to step back, reframe my perspective, and realized it was the perfect time to embark on an educational journey at MIT. &quot; Antonio explains.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Choosing MIT over other prestigious institutions like Harvard and Stanford was a no-brainer for Antonio, given his technical background. &quot;Not only did I want to experience MIT, but coincidentally, I knew someone from the previous year&#39;s AMP cohort \u2013 who said it was amazing,&quot; he says. Antonio&#39;s thirst for knowledge and desire for a unique learning experience led him to the doors of MIT, where he would ultimately transform his own trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The Birth of BeaverAI&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During his time at MIT AMP, Antonio Mel\u00e9 embarked on a unique project that would leave a lasting impact on his cohort. He created an AI chatbot named BeaverAI, a nod to MIT&#39;s beloved mascot, Tim the Beaver. BeaverAI swiftly evolved into the cohort\u2019s trusted sidekick, and all participants enjoyed testing prompts, and sharing feedback that contributed to its ongoing improvement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cms/delivery/media/MC35DTMKZHDZB3FOQZIOO7DPHIMA&quot; data-fileid=&quot;20Y4v000000KzAe&quot; data-contentkey=&quot;MC35DTMKZHDZB3FOQZIOO7DPHIMA&quot; data-cms-filename=&quot;beaverai.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BeaverAI chatbot interface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;BeaverAI is not just your run-of-the-mill chatbot. It is a formidable knowledge repository, crafted with research papers, inside jokes, and vital insights collected through AMP. With just a few clicks and prompts, cohort members can access a wealth of information, making their learning experience more efficient and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Antonio&#39;s creation of BeaverAI showcases his dedication to enhancing the learning experience for his peers. It exemplifies the collaborative and innovative spirit of MIT, where participants are encouraged to push boundaries and make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;AMP: Bridging Knowledge Gaps&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Antonio Mel\u00e9&#39;s journey through MIT AMP was marked by significant personal and professional growth. In the midst of a challenging company transformation, AMP equipped him with vital management skills and the ability to navigate complex systems and ambiguity. &quot;The pragmatic approach at MIT, driven by its &#39;mens et manus&#39; ethos, is what truly sets it apart. I learnt frameworks and tools that allowed me to redefine the problems I was addressing and craft successful strategies,&quot; Antonio reflects, highlighting the program&#39;s transformative impact on his career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Keeping the Global Cohort Connection Alive&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the unique aspects of AMP is its diverse and globally inclusive cohort. Antonio Mel\u00e9 cherishes the connections he forged during his time at MIT. &quot;We formed a diverse cohort, comprising 34 individuals from 20 different countries. The diversity of backgrounds and perspectives truly enriched the learning experience. I consider myself fortunate to have had such remarkable companions.

Rhode Island\u2019s innovative economic development strategy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.growblue.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grow Blue&lt;/a&gt;, is designed to advance the state\u2019s unique economic assets and strengths through ocean robotics, defense, ocean sciences, and marine tourism. Developed by a multi-stakeholder coalition of groups in the state, and supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://partnershipforrhodeisland.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Partnership for Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, the strategy had widespread backing from Rhode Island\u2019s business, government, and educational leaders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But as Rhode Island\u2019s leaders rolled the strategy out, they were continually asked the question: \u201cHow will the Blue Economy lead to jobs and investment?&quot; The Partnership responded by strengthening the connections between the Grow Blue strategy and the state\u2019s talent development pipelines. The playbook existed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.westerlyedcenter.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Westerly Education Center&lt;/a&gt;, which brings together higher education institutions, businesses, industry, and community partners to train people to meet projected workforce growth in the region. In one program, Westerly teaches thousands of welders, often with very little prior training, for hire by General Dynamics Electric Boat, which builds submarines for the US Navy.&amp;nbsp;The result: a triple win for people, whose careers and their lives enter into a new trajectory to prosperity, employers, who get the talent they need, and the region as a whole to advance its economic strategy. Now the Partnership is building on this success to convene organizations across the state to build efficient and effective workforce pipelines to drive the state\u2019s entire blue economy strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Finding and keeping talent is a big pain point for companies today. But as Rhode Island has discovered, the problem can\u2019t be solved by individual companies along. Instead, it takes a system. Giordano and Isaacs are now partnering to bring MIT\u2019s research and teaching capabilities and PRI\u2019s economic and convening power together to help more companies learn to do systems change that drives regional economic innovation, creates inclusive prosperity, and healthy, safe, resilient communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this 13-week program, participants will diagnose and take action on their company\u2019s and their larger region\u2019s strategy to train, hire, and retain a diverse, future-ready workforce with advanced relational and technical skills. As part of the program, participants will design and take early action on one \u201cinside the walls\u201d company-level improvement strategy and one \u201coutside the walls\u201d collective systems change strategy to develop a diverse, future-ready workforce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Participating companies should represent a major strategic pillar of their region\u2019s economic development strategy, and BILT-Lab participants should hold significant budgetary and decision-making responsibility for their company\u2019s inclusive future-ready workforce development strategy. Joint sponsorship from the CEO and head of Talent/HR/People is required, and participants are highly encouraged to sponsor local workforce development partners to attend BILT-Lab, including leaders from: local business coalitions and Chambers of Commerce, and local nonprofits, educational institutions, government, and foundations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;A powerful partnership&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The impetus for BILT-Lab grew over the last two years as &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/kate-w-isaacs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kate Isaacs&lt;/a&gt; (Senior Lecturer, MIT Sloan) and Tom Giordano partnered to think about how to equip more business leaders with the right mindset and skills to engage in place-based work. Combining their thought leadership and practical experience in areas of corporate social responsibility, community engagement, public-private partnerships, government infrastructure, and local business coalitions, BILT-Lab was born.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Isaac\u2019s research for the past twenty years has focused on the connection between business leadership for economic, environmental, and social thriving, which requires multi-stakeholder partnerships. Within the last five years, her thought leadership has expanded to include ways companies may be able to contribute to the talent crisis in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative we focus on reskilling people for the future,\u201d Isaacs states. \u201cI find that a lot of business leaders resonate with the idea of getting more local with their talent development and retention strategies. Talent is a national priority but regional needs are unique and the solutions are hyperlocal\u2014requiring intimate knowledge of the local stakeholder ecosystem.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an experienced advisor and executive for over a decade, Giordano brings the valuable perspective of business leaders, non-profit organizations, and government agencies. (He works closely with the Governor\u2019s office in Rhode Island to find ways to solve the systemic issues related to workforce, education, and infrastructure). As someone with boots on the ground, Giordano reveals, \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing with CEOs is that there\u2019s an enormous desire and continued priority to invest in an inclusive workforce development pipeline but there\u2019s very little common experience or knowledge sharing across regions, companies, cities, and towns. What works in one state is kept siloed and not often shared to benefit others.\u201d&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cms/delivery/media/MCJHEG5KZ56FD4VHTHZHLSO7TYAQ&quot; data-fileid=&quot;20Y4v000000Kz4C&quot; data-contentkey=&quot;MCJHEG5KZ56FD4VHTHZHLSO7TYAQ&quot; data-cms-filename=&quot;kate and tom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With BILT-Lab, Isaacs and Giordano intend to break down those silos and create a shared language and best practices \u2013 regardless of industry. \u201cBy building something at MIT Sloan we can use the academic firepower housed here, but also align those who are doing it on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Giordano states. \u201cWe\u2019re better preparing our companies to lead and doing so by including community and government leaders in that conversation. That\u2019s the only way it\u2019s going to work and be sustainable.\u201d&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Building a better pipeline&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The competition for talent \u2013 while facilitating inclusion and dignity in the workplace \u2013 has been a growing focus and priority among businesses in recent years. Successful business leaders have turned their attention to growing and developing talent from regional and local sources, while helping to solve larger systemic issues in the process. (The talent problem and issues related to infrastructure, childcare, affordable housing is often intertwined). \u201cWe see more business leaders wanting to provide leadership on those systemic issues, but they can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d Isaacs states. \u201cThey need to partner.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Isaacs shares a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chiefexecutive.net/ceos-pushing-community-prosperity/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; involving American Electric Power\u2019s (AEP) initiative to upskill coal workers in the midst of shuttering their coal plants in Appalachia. Instead of leaving the community high and dry, they evaluated the transferable skillset the current workforce possessed. Upon discovering a concentration of highly skilled metalworkers, AEP led systemic efforts to certify the region as \u201cAEROready \u201d in order to attract aerospace and aviation companies. While AEP was withdrawing its regional footprint in one way, it was elevating the community economy and workforce in other ways. This was not implemented purely out of altruism, there was a business benefit too. The stronger the regional economy,&amp;nbsp;the more business that AEP could do in the region. The business ROI matters when making the case for community investment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;The business case for inclusive prosperity&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Above all else, BILT-Lab is outcome-focused and results driven. Isaacs and Giordano are aware a moralistic argument alone for implementing systemic change isn\u2019t enough, especially in an increasingly polarized world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s about making practical arguments. The issues business leaders work on have to be tied to ROI and a successful strategy,\u201d Isaacs explains. As demonstrated in the AEP case study, you can\u2019t have good workforce participation if you\u2019re going to leave behind a significant part of the population. Yes, we need to do inclusivity and diversity because it\u2019s the right thing to do. However, the argument for change should also focus on what makes good business sense \u2013 in this case ensuring as much valuable talent as possible is being trained with the right skills and removing obstacles that hinder that flow of upskilling and reskilling. \u201cTalent is evenly distributed in the population but opportunity is not. We simply cannot exclude large portions of the population if we\u2019re going to hope to be competitive on the global stage.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;"

                "value": "&lt;p&gt;Giordano agrees that focusing on corporate social responsibility, DEI, and ESG are more digestible when one can demonstrate there\u2019s value not just for the community, but the company bottom line. \u201cIf a large investment house is no longer talking about ESG, for example, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re pulling back from the community,\u201d Giordano states. \u201cIt just means they need to better understand where to place those funds, time, resources, and volunteer hours. They need to know the investment is being impactful, and place-based is the way to do it.\u201d BILT-Lab will help participants develop a playbook about how to engage with local thriving that provides a strategic and practical business case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing risk, accelerating learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCEOs, community-based organization, governors, mayors \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter what side of the political aisle they\u2019re on, they\u2019re all prioritizing a workforce development pipeline,\u201d Giordano reveals. However, while everyone is trying to implement these initiatives, there\u2019s a lack of communication and shared experiences that hinder the outcome or waste effort by reinventing solutions that are already out there but are hidden away in a regional pocket of innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Giordano continued, \u201cBILT-Lab will be impactful in limiting the amount of waste and error. By sharing best practices, learning from one another, building the common language, and understanding what the landscape looks like, participants will emerge with a strategic plan that is not only primed to succeed, but fundable. By attending they\u2019re not only going to save time and money on their efforts, but they\u2019re also going to save on failure.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Isaacs further expands that while many business leaders want to drive systemic change, they can\u2019t make meaningful impact alone. BILT-Lab will provide the opportunity for participants to explore new ways of leadership that don\u2019t rely on formal positional authority. The traditional command and control framework isn\u2019t effective when convening multiple outside stakeholders. (Isaacs\u2019 research on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/why-distributed-leadership-future-management&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;distributed leadership&lt;/a&gt; reflects this.) \u201cParticipants will explore how to lead responsibly in these situations. How do they use the power they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have \u2013 convening power, economic power, the power of their reputation in the community \u2013 to bring folks together and make things happen?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to build that shared language, participants will review various case studies and best practices. There will also be a module focused on defining personal leadership styles so participants can bring their authentic selves to the table and build trust with various stakeholders. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe space for them to reflect on these big questions around power, equity, and authenticity. People will be contributing to each other\u2019s learning as much as they\u2019ll be learning themselves.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other tangible takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;BILT-Lab participants should bring a strategic priority they\u2019re ready to workshop and accomplish as part of their current role. In addition, each participant/team will be assigned a coach they\u2019ll meet with through the duration of the program to provide valuable advice regarding their implementation strategy and ensure they stay on track.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFirst, participants of BILT-Lab will leave with a shared mindset,\u201d Giordano states. \u201cSecond, they\u2019ll leave with a strategic plan or \u2018playbook\u2019 that will allow them to execute in the world what they designed in the classroom. And lastly, we\u2019ll focus on funding. I think it\u2019s important that future participants know they\u2019re leaving with something they can hold in their hand, as well as newly refined relational and team skills.\u201d&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Isaacs expands further on the classroom experience. Participants will have access to various MIT faculty from across the Institute (not just Sloan) who are thought leaders on systemic change. There will also be a variety of guest speakers who are experts on the place-based dimension of corporate social responsibility and sustainability across a variety of industries and sectors. Lastly, they\u2019ll learn a lot from their fellow participants. They\u2019ll leave having built a valuable ecosystem they can continuously rely on. \u201cBILT-Lab will seed the beginning of a best-practice clearing house that defines how you do this work well and develop that shared knowledge base.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should attend?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ideal program participants are \u201cCompany leaders from regions that are looking to compete,\u201d Giordano states succinctly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Isaacs adds that participants should hold a senior position within their organization and be sponsored by the CEO to ensure accountability between the project they are advancing in the BILT-Lab and the top-level strategic priorities of their company. \u201cWe\u2019ll be inviting the sponsors to the closing session to hear what participants have done in the program and highlight the value they\u2019ve created.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They also encourage participants to attend alongside local business peers who share their commitment and are willing to collaborate in building and scaling an inclusive workforce development pipeline. In addition, companies are encouraged to bring two or more local non-business partners who will be important contributors to the project they have in mind. \u201cFor example,\u201d Isaacs offers \u201cif it\u2019s a project to upskill workers, is there an educational institution and a non-profit partner in the community that would be important stakeholders? Think of it as an opportunity to align and build trust in a core leadership team across sectors.\u201d&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hinting at who else will already be in the room, Giordano reveals participants include a community foundation from Texas, a state university, and members from other business-led coalitions across the country. \u201cThe common thread is they feel their regions need some professional leadership development or skill building in order to compete.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about BILT-Lab and apply for the 2024 session &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/businesses-for-inclusive-local-thriving-lab/a054v00000tBbUsAAK.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

Ancona is the author of &lt;em&gt;X-Teams: How to Build Teams That Lead, Innovate, and Succeed&lt;/em&gt; (Harvard Business School Press) and teaches courses involving X-team curriculum at MIT Sloan Executive Education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The current business landscape is shaped by new technologies, work patterns, and a changing workforce with changing expectations, as Ancona explains. To lead teams effectively in these turbulent times, Ancona introduces an organizational model with distributed leadership where teams are built with end-to-end accountability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In contrast to traditional organizational models with top-down hierarchy and siloed teams, the distributed leadership model allows for nimble, cross-functional teams that work in alignment with an organization\u2019s overall strategic direction. Teams that work externally and across team boundaries are known as \u201cX-teams,\u201d and these teams are what allow organizations to stay flexible, customer-focused, and innovative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;X-Teams &amp;amp; Distributed Leadership&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The three main components of implementing X-team collaboration are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Sensemaking&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Task coordination&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Ambassadorship&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sensemaking is understanding the context in which you are working by collaborating across departments and the entire organization and working outside the organization to understand competitors, the industry, and your customers. Through task coordination, all members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://exec.mit.edu/s/blog-post/how-to-combat-team-failure-and-drive-innovation-using-the-x-team-MCEWNZOLUORBBRHIXBSIJF7ZOA3Q&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; can participate in this process and come together afterward to debrief the findings. Once you determine next steps, you bring ideas to senior leadership through ambassadorship to ensure that all teams are aligned and accepting of the organization\u2019s current strategic direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing the X-Team Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some challenges to implementing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://exec.mit.edu/s/blog-post/how-externally-focused-teams-x-teams-can-modernize-an-organization-MCNVTI773PGBB73HOKKLSUUGUFJM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;X-team model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are a mental model that is focused on internal work, fear of a loss of control and chaos, and uncertainty about how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ancona provides key steps to combat these challenges and put X-teams into practice at your organization:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educate: &lt;/strong&gt;Get people comfortable with the idea of change and being future-forward. Speak with teams that have implemented the X-team model to learn how they did it, what worked, and what didn\u2019t. Focus on gains over losses.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take It One Step at a Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct one information-seeking endeavor at a time. For example, have all members of the team interview one satisfied customer to illuminate what the organization is excelling at. Learn about what competitors are doing. Brainstorm with outside experts, identify key findings, and communicate them to your teams.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put Up Guardrails:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure that all members at every level of the organization understand its strategic direction. When X-teams are producing many new ideas, bring them through a funnel so only the best, key ideas will be further developed and implemented. Create simple rules and empower team members to have quality control over new ideas.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transform Your Leadership at MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the face of management evolves, organizations are increasingly favoring collaborative and distributed leadership models. MIT\u2019s &lt;a href=&quot;https://executive.mit.edu/course/transforming-your-leadership-strategy/a056g00000URaNAAA1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Transforming Your Leadership&lt;/a&gt; course, taught by Professor Deborah Ancona, teaches you how to drive innovation, maximize team performance, and develop the personal leadership skills necessary to succeed in today\u2019s world of fast-paced change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this course, you\u2019ll be introduced to Transformational Leadership Theory through MIT\u2019s unique 4-CAPs+ Leadership Framework. This framework allows you to uncover four capabilities of effective leadership and the ability to harness, align, and leverage these capabilities throughout your organization.&lt;/p&gt;"
